<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">******[Further to our meeting on &lt;day name&gt; &lt;day of the month&gt; 
  th/rd/st &lt;Month&gt; &lt;year&gt;, I am writing to advise that although I 
  have tried to progress the enquiry with you, I have been unable to do so. I 
  will therefore assume that you do not wish to pursue our proposal for the products 
  and services discussed at our meeting so will not attempt to contact you again 
  in relation to this matter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I would however like to continue to provide you with updates and newsletters 
  about CNC which I hope will be of interest at some point in the future?]******</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So that we can monitor our own quoting procedures, can I ask you just a couple 
  of questions relating to our quotation?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">* What was the main reason for not selecting CNC, i.e. price, location, offer 
  etc </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">* Do you have any other comments on our general proposal or way of providing 
  a quotation that you think we need to review? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">* May we ask which supplier was finally chosen to complete the works?<br>
  <br>
  Your feedback can be e-mailed to sales@cnc-ltd.co.uk and is much appreciated.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Should you wish to revisit anything we have discussed however, please do not 
  hesitate to contact myself, Gary Jowett or Valerie King in sales who will be 
  happy to respond promptly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As agreed, Valerie will call you in [*******] when you may be reviewing your 
  IT Contract again.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once again, thank you for your time and interest and I look forward to possibly 
  speaking to you in the near future.</font></p>
