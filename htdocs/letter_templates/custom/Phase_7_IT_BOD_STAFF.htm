<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear 
  {title} {lastName},</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hello, 
  its me again Valerie from CNC. This time I am writing to you, so you can see 
  what is going on in <strong>Grahams head!</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
  the leaflet enclosed portrays, Graham is full of practical business ideas backed 
  up with twenty five years of experience in IT.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Graham 
  will take the time in getting to know you and the most effective ways to improve 
  the IT in your business. <strong>Do you question whether your IT person/staff 
  have the experience, the up to date knowledge and understanding of the latest 
  technologies to do this? Has your IT person/staff ever presented you with full documentation of your IT system?</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He 
  fully understands all customer needs and although very technical, he explains 
  things easily, especially for those of you who do not have any IT knowledge.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is why CNC do not employ sales people, which is why Graham is assigned to the initial meeting and the on-going relationship with your business.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Graham 
  would love to meet with you and as my previous letter explained he would be 
  able to conduct a <strong>FREE</strong> no obligation <strong>IT Audit</strong> 
  in your first meeting, if required.</font></p>
  
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
  you would be interested in taking this opportunity to meet Graham, please do 
  not hesitate to contact me to arrange a convenient date and time.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
  will contact you shortly to enquire if you would be interested in meeting the 
  real human head!</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yours 
  sincerely,</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">for and on behalf 
  of CNC</font></p>
