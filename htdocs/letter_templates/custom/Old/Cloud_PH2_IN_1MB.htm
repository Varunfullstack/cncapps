</font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Let us help you 
  separate the hype from the reality to truly understand whether a Cloud Solution 
  would be best for your business.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> You may be reaching 
  that time again where your IT needs replacing due to old age, performance and 
  reliability. Faced with a barrage of <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> options 
  you may be at a cross roads and unsure of which path to take.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> You have the 
  option to buy another server and associated software but will you be expected 
  to keep this for another five years? You maybe tempted by the cloud model such 
  as <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong> that provides you with hosted versions 
  of the most used applications such as Exchange?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Some of the technologies 
  and solutions are still at an early stage, being swept along on a wave of hype 
  and marketing budgets &#8211; <strong>are they ready right now and are they 
  right for your company?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Conversely you 
  don&#8217;t want to invest in a solution that is going to be outdated within 
  a year knowing that you have to run it for the next 5 years to justify the investment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Many vendors, 
  resellers and IT consultancies you speak to will have an ulterior motive to 
  steer you in one direction.</font></p>

  we already have clients using both approaches, so we can give you an unbiased 
  opinion as to which is more suitable and appropriate for your business.</font></p>
