<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear 
  {title} {lastName},</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following 
  our previous discussions <strong>regarding IT support</strong> I thought I would 
  write to reintroduce you to CNC.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  We are a specialist IT Support Company with over 15 years&#8217; experience 
  in our field of expertise. With a recent re-launch of the company which goes 
  beyond a new logo, literature and website we are intending to provide our 120 
  existing clients and new customers with a service that is <strong>much more 
  than day to day IT support.</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
  have invested heavily in our internal systems and our customers now have direct 
  access to reports, service requests, stats and SLA&#8217;s plus financial information 
  from within a secure web portal.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
  is one of our most important developments which allow our customers to get a 
  window into what we are doing and how well we are performing.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Ask yourself the following typical questions about your current provider; <strong>Our 
  clients have access to all this information and more at any time, do you?</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  &#8226; How many calls have we placed?<br>
  &#8226; How quickly do they respond?<br>
  &#8226; Are they hitting the Service Level Agreement?<br>
  &#8226; What areas of the network are causing us most trouble and are these 
  being addressed?<br>
  &#8226; What is the status of current outstanding calls?<br>
  &#8226; What invoices have been raised and for what?<br>
  &#8226; What are my on-going costs for Software Renewals and Support</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Alongside this, the ServiceDesk has continued to expand and the company now 
  has over double the amount of staff in technical compared to the sales function. 
  So you can be assured that should you become a client we will provide you with 
  excellent service.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Our attention to detail and emphasis on quality is representative of <strong>CNC&#8217;s 
  commitment to exceeding our client's high levels of expectations.</strong> We 
  also can offer you a <strong>FREE </strong>no obligation audit of your IT system 
  to demonstrate what CNC can do for you. </font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
  will contact you presently to confirm receipt of the information and to progress 
  with any enquiry you may have. If I can be of any further assistance in the 
  meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
  look forward to speaking to you soon.</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yours sincerely,</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">for and on behalf 
  of CNC</font></p>
