  <p align="center" class="style2"><strong>Partners required for a new Disaster Recovery solution for SME's </strong></p>
  <p>I am writing to introduce <em>the 2ndSite </em> Disaster Recovery service for SME's for which we are engaging a number of insurance brokers to generate leads for us to develop. </p>
  <p>Business Continuity, as recently featured in the <strong>recent BIBA campaign</strong>, is on the radar for many SME's as they look to reduce the risks of business and system downtime. 2ndSite addresses the systems element of such a strategy and immediately provides you with a service offering in this area. </p>
  <p>2ndSite can provide you with <strong>an additional service offering </strong> to your commercial end user's for <strong> no upfront investment. </strong>The service is offered to partners on a <strong>commission </strong> basis – provide us with a valid sales lead and if the customer is signed a <strong>commission </strong>will be payable to your company. </p>
  <p>2ndSite is a <strong>business driven </strong> solution and as such your brokerage team does not require extensive training on the technical aspects as our team can address once the lead is passed over. </p>
  <p>2ndSite is up and running and established with our existing customers - a marketing campaign to the wider market commences in February of this year. We can <strong>provide you with marketing collateral </strong> should you wish to market to you customer base. </p>
  <p>To sum up the benefits to you and your brokerage team: </p>
