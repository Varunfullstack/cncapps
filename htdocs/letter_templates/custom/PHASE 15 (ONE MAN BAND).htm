<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whether you are a small or medium size user, using a one-man band could be inexpensive, but very risky to the running of your IT systems longer term. Having taken over a number of companies that previously used one person we have discovered the following:</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#149;&nbsp; No reliable backup;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#149;&nbsp; They did not provide any Service Level Agreement;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#149;&nbsp; They were unable to provide  24-hour cover; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#149;&nbsp; They were difficult to get hold of especially in an emergency; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#149;&nbsp; They did not provide any on-line monitoring or management tools; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
