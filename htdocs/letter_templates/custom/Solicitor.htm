<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
  a company you depend on your fee earners to generate revenue and if they are 
  not productive this can directly impact your profitability. You will be surprised 
  how often the IT can hinder the staff of many businesses.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  We thought you may be interested in reading one local solicitors experience 
  working with CNC to bring their IT infrastructure in line with the business 
  requirements and the positives this has brought to the business. Following the 
  departure of their in-house IT person, the company made the decision to review 
  options for outsourcing as an alternative to an expensive internal employee.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  It was felt that a lack of knowledge and proactivity from the IT Person had 
  resulted in a lack of investment over the long term and an aged infrastructure 
  that was not meeting company requirements. Degradation in performance and reliability 
  was constant year on year with the IT Person failing to address the fundamental 
  problems of the underlying infrastructure and was instead papering over the 
  cracks.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  As a result IT was directly impacting staff productivity and when the majority 
  are fee earners this has a big impact on the company&#8217;s profitability. 
  After a rigorous review process and assessment, CNC was selected to act as the 
  sole IT resource within the organisation bypassing the need for an expensive 
  in-house IT Person.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  The company heeded the advice of CNC&#8217;s audit and refreshed the IT at server 
  and pc level with our consultant following a detailed project plan to minimise 
  disruption. The end result was a modern, high performance system that has increased 
  the productivity of many of the staff who no longer had to wait 20 minutes for 
  a PC to start up or burdened by daily system crashes.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  In addition, the company's partners now have an insight into the IT and its 
  associated costs. They can now plan accordingly to ensure it meets the on-going 
  IT needs of the business.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
  will contact you presently to confirm receipt of this letter and to enquire 
  if you would be interested in meeting with one of my colleagues to discuss this 
  further.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If I can be of 
  any further assistance in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yours sincerely,</font></p>
