<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Listed below 
  are <strong>nine</strong> questions you may wish to ask yourself?</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> From a 
      business perspective do you have a &#8220;feeling&#8221; that something 
      is not right with the IT but lack the information to know what&#8217;s wrong 
      and how to correct it?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Do you 
      know what he does on a day to day basis and why he does it?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How do 
      you know if he is fixing problems or just papering over the cracks?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Are you 
      in control of your IT or is he in control of you?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Do you 
      measure his performance against service levels &#8211; response time, fix 
      time - to understand if they deliver a good service to the business?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Is he making 
      himself look busy to cover up a lack of activity during idle periods?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Can you 
      state with 100% conviction that you get a decent Return On Investment from 
      the money you spend on IT?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Do you know 
      how many problems he has to deal with and how long it takes to fix them?</font></li>
    <li> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Do you 
      know how much the IT costs you and where that money goes?</font></li>
  </ol>
