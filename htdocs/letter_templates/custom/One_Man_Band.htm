<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Listed below are <strong>Ten</strong> reasons why your business could suffer 
  by relying on <strong>One person</strong> to support your IT system:</font></p>
</font> 
<ol>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is the knowledge 
    of your IT system only with them?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The lack of 
    IT documentation can be catastrophic</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> If they move 
    on or retire, you and your colleagues will be left with no information relating 
    to your computer system</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> When you call 
    them do you get through to their mobile while they are on another customer 
    site? Ask yourself what calls they are taking whilst on your premises?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Just because 
    they go on holiday, does not mean your system and business take a break. If 
    a disaster occurs whilst they are away what do you do?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Are on-going 
    issues investigated and fixed or just patched over?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Are you experiencing 
    more and more niggles with your system? Have upgrades and updates been recommended? 
    Systems need to be tended to and managed otherwise they will fail</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> If your server 
    comes to a halt so does your business. In such a scenario you need a guaranteed 
    response and fix &#8211; what service level agreement is in place with this 
    person?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Are your servers 
    constantly being monitored?</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Do they have 
    the knowledge and expertise to ensure your system evolves with the business?</font></li>
