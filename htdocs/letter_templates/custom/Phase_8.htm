  {title} {lastName},</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We truly believe that not all IT Support companies are the same and I would like to show you the reasons why CNC are different.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
  do this I have enclosed a leaflet showing some of the benefits as to why our 
  customers enjoy a long term working relationship with CNC. I am hoping you can 
  recognise the reasons and benefits as well.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our philosophy at CNC is to provide excellent service and advice at all-times which is why we aim to provide 100% uptime of your computer systems. You will also benefit from our skills and expertise to design, install and provide the on-going support for your entire IT Infrastructure.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You will see we have been servicing the business community by providing IT solutions and support since 1996. In this time we have developed a comprehensive range of products and services allowing us to deal with companies from 5 to 250 users in size.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You do not have to deal with sales people and get tied into long-term contracts, just an on-going relationship which is trusted, open and very pro-active. We are totally committed to your business.</font></p>
  
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Can 
  you see how this would benefit your company from both a productivity and profitable 
  way?</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Graham 
  Lind, our Technical Director, would love the opportunity to meet with you and 
  conduct a <strong>FREE</strong> system review of your IT on how it could improve 
  your business. </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Please remember that you are under no obligations to use our services if Graham does visit you to review your IT and conduct an audit.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Do you remember the last time your IT systems were reviewed?</strong></font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps 
  this is a good time to do so? I would like to thank you for reading this letter 
  and I hope you can take the time to read the leaflet as well. I am planning 
  to call you in the next week to hear what you think and whether or not I can 
  arrange a meeting for Graham to visit you.</font></p>
<p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yours 
  sincerely,</font></p>
