******[Further to our meeting on <day name> <day of the month> th/rd/st <Month> <year> and your subsequent telephone conversation with my colleague Valerie King, I am writing to thank you for your time and for updating us as to your position.

I understand that you are still considering our proposals and will contact us when you are in a position to proceed.]********

******[Further to our meeting on <day name> <day of the month> th/rd/st <Month> <year>, I am writing to advise that although I have tried to progress the enquiry with you, I have been unable to do so.  I will therefore assume that you do not wish to pursue our proposal for the products and services discussed at our meeting so will not attempt to contact you again in relation to this matter.

I would however like to continue to provide you with updates and newsletters about CNC which I hope will be of interest at some point in the future?]******

So that we can monitor our own quoting procedures, can I ask you just a couple of questions relating to our quotation?

* What was the main reason for not selecting CNC, i.e. price, location, offer etc 

* Do you have any other comments on our general proposal or way of providing a quotation that you think we need to review? 

* May we ask which supplier was finally chosen to complete the works?
 
Your feedback can be e-mailed to sales@cnc-ltd.co.uk and is much appreciated.

Should you wish to revisit anything we have discussed however, please do not hesitate to contact myself, Gary Jowett or Valerie King in sales who will be happy to respond promptly.

As agreed, Valerie will call you in [*******] when you may be reviewing your IT Contract again.

Once again, thank you for your time and interest and I look forward to possibly speaking to you in the near future.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.
