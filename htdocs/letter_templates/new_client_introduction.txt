Further to a recent telephone conversation between myself and your colleague, I am writing as requested to introduce CNC to you.

CNC are a quality computer solution provider with over 20-year's experience in IT infrastructure design and support. We operate a fully staffed helpdesk facility manned by highly qualified personnel, supporting a team of engineers that are available for on-site work if required. CNC technicians are backed up by the latest support technology that allows us to pro-actively monitor your server infrastructure diagnosing and resolving potential issues before they become problems.

In addition, all of our technicians are required to sit an extensive practical exam to ensure they can address all of the network issues and problems our clients would typically encounter in the day to day running of their IT. This attention to details and emphasis on quality is representative of CNC's commitment to exceeding our client's high levels of expectations.

I have enclosed CNC details of our products and services together with a complimentary mouse mat.

I will contact you presently to confirm receipt of the information and to progress with any enquiry you may have. If I can be of any further assistance in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me.
