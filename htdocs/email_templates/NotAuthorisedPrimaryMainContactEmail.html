    Dear {primaryMainContactName}
</p>
<p>
    {contactName} tried to raise a support request directly but they currently have the support level
    {contactSupportLevel} and as such are unable to do so. If you would like them to be able to raise requests then
    please log onto our portal and change their support level or alternatively contact us directly to raise this on
    their behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Kind Regards
