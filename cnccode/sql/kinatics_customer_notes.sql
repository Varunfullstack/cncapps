So far we are continuing with our IT provider as I have a large ERP roll out in process and therefore stability in the remaining IT system and their local LAN knowledge is essential to this project.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the beginning of 2011, things would have settled down and I will be in a position to take stock and make a clearer plan of our future requirements.\r\n\r\nSo, I suggest you drop me a line in January 2011 to catch up.\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','30',NULL);

He is currently using a company in Leeds & has not really got any niggles & has had a long term healthy relationship with them. He is interested in our services & would like to know more about CNC. At this stage he does not want the office manager to know that he is looking for another supplier that is local. He wants to discuss management systems & scanning so they can become more paper less & he wants to come to us rather than CC go there at this stage. He is also interested in our One to One showcase of upgrading SBS/Windows 2008 to Windows 7. They already have Blackberrys & use Terminal Services.

Current company is in Leeds which is too far. POND is the name of the company. \r\n\r\nCurrently 2 divisions running on same server – they may split these next year. \r\n\r\nWants to go paperless – 150,000 paper records to archive off. \r\n\r\nHe is looking at Document Management but we suggested perhaps this is overkill. \r\n\r\n12 TS users/ licence for 20, 5 concurrent.  It seems he is running TS on the SBS box so we assume that this is a virtualised set-up?\r\n\r\n2 x ADSL lines – both from BT though. \r\n\r\nPlans for geographical expansion next year and push for more remote working.  \r\n\r\nDiscussed Citrix and TS on SBS 2008. \r\n\r\nMore of an introductory meeting at this stage but he did say he liked what we had to say and what he saw. \r\n\r\nI told him I will contact him in a few months to see how things are going\r\n\r\n19/5/10 - not in office today. sent email.\r\n\r\nHi Terry,\r\n\r\nIts been a while since you last visited our offices to discuss IT.

This is obviously a disappointment for us; considering the amount of time we put into understanding your requirements via face to face meetings and developing a solution which we were convinced would meet your expectations. \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, I now have to explain to my directors why, after the amount of resource put into working on this opportunity, we have been unsuccessful. Since our last telephone conversation I have tried multiple times to make contact with you via the office and mobile without success and sent a few emails which were not responded to.  This puts me in a difficult position as I have had no feedback from yourselves. \r\n\r\nWe except that you have selected an alternative vendor but, as a matter of courtesy, would you mind replying to this email explaining why CNC was not selected – cost, incorrect solution etc.  Please be as honest and descriptive as possible.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance on this. \r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\n6/4/10 - emails from Martin:\r\n\r\nCraig.\r\n \r\nBeleive me once all the crap is out of the way we will be in touch.\r\n \r\nMartin\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nFrom: Craig Chantler <CraigC@cnc-ltd.co.uk>\r\nTo: Martin Turner <martin.marden@btinternet.com>\r\nCc: \"sean.short@fsmail.net\" <sean.short@fsmail.net>\r\nSent: Wednesday, 31 March, 2010 13:53:07\r\nSubject: RE: IT Contract\r\nThanks for the update Martin and we fully understand the political situation.

The decision did eventually come partly down to price on the support costs only, the hardware cost was very close. The other deciding factor was that I did not have the confidence that DMS where going to assist in anyway (Andrew knows where I\'m coming from on his dealings with DMS)with any information transfer and the board considered this to be to greater risk for the business to take, the pen system would have been a very easy area for DMS to have caused us issues and would have ended up in a blame / finger pointing problem.\r\n \r\nThe fact that DMS are partly owned by our major shareholder did not make things easy either, I know what it like to put a lot of effort into a bid only to loose it, it is in no way a bad reflection of you or CNC, quite the contrary and I would have no hesitation in recommending CNC to others.\r\n \r\nI would like to thank you for all your efforts\r\n \r\nKind regards\r\n \r\nMartin Turner\r\n','30',NULL);

They recently upgraded it and put in 1TB SATA disks! (he did, not the supplier!) They run Sage, LakeView and Exchange on SBS 2003 on this box!\r\n\r\n1900 for TS. 3 years old, dual processors. \r\n\r\nthey have had downtime on the server and BB but each time the MD has not signed off on safeguards.  They almost treat the IT with contempt in terms of investment. \r\n\r\n26 users. \r\n\r\nADSL MAx (he thinks) from Demon.  Mentioned dual bb which has been proposed in the past but dismissed. \r\n\r\n10 Remote workers - 4 concurrent.  Mentioned the limitations of a single line, u/g to ADSL 2+, not interested in spending money to improve remoter services!\r\n\r\nCurrent company is All Teks maidstone. Â£45 a hour for call outs.  They only monitor the servers for him and he does all the maintenenace. \r\n\r\nHe said we could do a survey if we like but he would just use it to suggest improvements himself.  \r\n\r\nWaste of time. \r\n\r\nSent this email:\r\n\r\nHi Ian,\r\n\r\nThanks for your time last week, it was good to meet you.\r\n\r\nAs regards an onsite audit by one of our engineers I have discussed this with one of the Directors and feel at this stage we cannot justify the expense as it is obvious that you are currently very happy with the existing supplier. \r\n\r\nIf your situation does change in the future please feel free to contact us and perhaps we can look at a review at that point in time. \r\n\r\n\r\n','44','0');

He thinks its time to review the IT and supplier.  \r\n\r\nThey run Sage Line 200, Goldmine, HireMate, Tesseract for apps.  Remote staff access these over VPN. \r\n\r\nThe current supplier has suggested SDSL - I told him this was a dead technology and is a last resort. Looked at broadband checker - Infinity will be available in June this year.  Discussed this with him.   \r\n\r\nSamknows shows this though - Your location should be able to receive service of up to 2Mbps If possible, check with a phone number as these are far more accurate. \r\n\r\nSo no wonder they may be experiencing slowness across the link!\r\n\r\nAlso discussed Citrix - there appears to be a strong case for this solution on first viewing and perhaps consolidation of the remote servers?  My guess is the remote servers are replicating d/b files so we need to determine whether citrix could replace this.  \r\n\r\nThey also have  a VOIP system but dont use it across offices....!!\r\n\r\nThey pay per month for an all inclusive service at the moment.  onsite is charged as additional. \r\n\r\nHe is based in Eastbourne so you could mention this Adrian..he probably hangs out in the same pubs as you - he\'s about 50 odd....\r\n\r\nCurrent company is in Bristol so locality shouldnt be an issue. \r\n\r\nAC booked in for 27th May\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','44','0');

As such I thought it would be worth restabilising contact to see if we can help you at all at this time. \r\n\r\nThere is often a disconnect between the business and IT, due to the lack of knowledge the IT department is often unaccountable with the business unable to monitor and manage expenditure and progress.  We have developed a customer portal that allows our clients at any time to view:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ How many calls have we placed?\r\nâ€¢ How quickly do they respond?\r\nâ€¢ Are they hitting the Service Level Agreement?\r\nâ€¢ What areas of the network are causing us most trouble and are these being addressed?\r\nâ€¢ What is the status of current outstanding calls?\r\nâ€¢ What invoices have been raised and for what?\r\nâ€¢ What are my on-going costs for Software Renewals and Support\r\nThis allows us to offer a true strategic approach to IT and for clients to budget and plan more effectively.  We are often more accountable than an internal IT department and can save you money in the process!\r\n\r\nIf this sounds of interest we can offer a free review of your IT.  Please contact me for more details. \r\n\r\nIf you are truly happy with the status of your IT then please accept my apologies for this prospective email.  \r\n','44','0');

Therefore we are in a strong position to advise on the pros and cons of each. \r\n\r\nTo help you determine the best course of action we offer a free, no obligation IT audit and report along with recommendations and costs for the solution and on-going support. \r\n\r\nOh, by the way â€“ we now offer extended support hours for our fully managed accounts, from 7:30am to 8:00pm, for no additional charge.  So if you are now working shift patterns or have found yourself needing to reboot your server when your employees are out of the office this may be of use!\r\n\r\nIf you feel any of this could be of interest, please contact me if you would like more information\r\n\r\n\r\n','44','0');

However she is in a very awkward situation, being new, and doesnâ€™t want to rock the boat. \r\n\r\nShe will not entertain a meeting at this point and wanted rough figures to see whether its viable or not to outsource. \r\n\r\nI gave her prices of Â£1400 for servers and Â£20-Â£25 for user support. \r\n\r\nI asked for more details so she sent me the attached â€“ reports of what the IT guy is up to on a daily basis and a network schematic.\r\n\r\nFew things:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	The servers are around 3-4 years old based on processors, SBS 2008.  They do not have a lot of memory and only one processor.  \r\nâ€¢	I donâ€™t understand what the virtual PC is doing running Exchange 2003?  It could be that they have exceeded the limit of SBS?  They have 30 office system users but 60 engineers who receive jobs to their blackberryâ€™s so I assume they have to be down as users on domain.  \r\nâ€¢	Looking at the schematic there is obviously room here for consolidation/ refresh of the servers\r\nâ€¢	These engineers then use pen and tablet pcâ€™s to record and complete job sheets\r\nâ€¢	I believe this line of business app is managed by the supplier but she seemed confused when I asked about this\r\nâ€¢	Looking at his time sheets it is obvious he is trying to time fill but he seems to be involved quite a bit on managing/ maintaining the tablets which could be a problem for us. \r\n\r\nWe would need a site survey here for more details of their systems but this may prove difficult at the moment.  We need more details on how their line of business application is managed/ supported and whether we can support the tablets?  \r\n\r\nI think this could be tricky to support as it currently stands.

They need a quick turnaround on faulty pens which he gets involved in but he has limited knowledge of the server infrastructure.  He also gets involved in day to day pc issues but nothing beyond this really. \r\n\r\nI told her in this sort of scenario we would work with the internal resource.  Us managing the servers and him dealing with line of business app issues and pc issues with occasional pass over to us if he is unable to resolve. \r\n\r\nShe was looking for complete outsourcing but this is going to be difficult to do with the application they are using certainly in the first instance. \r\n\r\nShe is aware he is useless on the IT infrastructure front and this is being neglected and they are having issues as a result.  She is aware we could improve things but this takes her business case from â€˜complete outsourcing to save moneyâ€™ to â€œ enhancing system reliability and performanceâ€ which she is going to have to go away and think about.\r\n \r\nI told her we could do a no obligation survey working with the IT guy so we donâ€™t tread on his toes, which would give them an indication of what state their systems are in.  I emphasised the fact that if they are being neglected they are potentially heading for major failure at the end of increasing reliability and performance issuesâ€¦.she is aware of this.

You were under the impression that the application in use was not fit for purpose and the IT resource was maybe a drain on resources and lacked the necessary skills and knowledge in certain areas. \r\n\r\nAt the time we were unable to help you as our focus at that time was infrastructure. \r\n\r\nHowever, we are now partnering with a very exciting Mobile Field Service Management company which I believe have an application that could drastically improve efficiencies and reduce costs of your mobile workforce. \r\n\r\nWe can offer a FULL outsourcing service along with this including all infrastructure which is what you were originally looking for.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently in talks with a commercial refrigeration company that has 130 engineers for this complete service including system and outsourcing as they believe it can increase margins and provide differentiation in tender situations. \r\n\r\nThe partner company in question is called OneServe and Â£8 million has been invested in the software.  The solution is cloud based so you pay per user, it can scale with your business and you do not need any additional infrastructure. \r\n\r\nYour mobile operatives can USE THEIR OWN MOBILES to integrate directly to the back office. So you could get rid of all those legacy digital pen devices that really impact operations when they fail. \r\n\r\nThe system intelligently schedules operatives for jobs based on skillset, location and availability\r\n\r\nAs proven by recent installs the system can yield the following benefits:\r\n\r\n40% Back Office Savings or Â£100,000 per annum based on 6 staff doing the work of 10\r\n\r\n25% productivity savings or Â£720,000 per annum based on 72 engineers doing the work of 100\r\n\r\n30% fuel savings or Â£120,00 per annum based on a fleet of 100 vehicles\r\n\r\nIn addition massive improvements in customer service have been demonstrated:\r\n\r\n98% of appointments achieved at first contact\r\nOnly 4% missed appointments\r\n95% first time fix\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss this further, and can spare an hour or two I am happy to meet with you or have a conversation over the phone. \r\n\r\nThe MD and the FD from the refrigeration company I mentioned above came to our offices as they are exactly the same situation as you were when we last spoke and needed some privacy so we would welcome you to our offices if this is convenient?\r\n\r\nIf this is now not of relevance my apologies for making you read through my, hopefully not too long, message!','44','0');

You had a number of issues related to the software and infrastructure. \r\n\r\nAt that time our audit focused on the hardware but I believe that most of the fundamental problems stem from the software. \r\n\r\nWe are now partnering with a leading edge Field Service Management solution which, based on what I know about your business could provide a solution to your problems. \r\n\r\nWe can offer a full outsourced service for infrastructure along with this solution. \r\n\r\nThe company is called OneServe.\r\n\r\nAnd this is why we believe in them:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Â£8 million worth of development in the software  has created a leading edge solution with long term stability\r\nâ€¢	A management team with proven experience and credibility \r\nAnd why we believe in their solution:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Cutting edge Cloud based solution built from the ground up to provide flexibility which could reduce the infrastructure needed at each of your offices and integrate your company\r\nâ€¢	Flexible pay per user per month licensing moves with your business â€“ add or subtract users as you need to\r\nâ€¢	Provide Instant updates and reports on jobs available to the back office and management- all company process now work in real time\r\nâ€¢	No need for expensive propriety PDAâ€™s \r\nâ€¢	Mobile operatives can use their own mobile phones to complete job orders and find out where they need to be\r\nâ€¢	The system intelligently schedules operatives for jobs based on skillset, location and availability\r\nAs proven by recent installs the system can yield the following benefits:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	40% Back Office Savings or Â£100,000 per annum based on 6 staff doing the work of 10\r\nâ€¢	25% productivity savings or Â£720,000 per annum based on 72 engineers doing the work of 100\r\nâ€¢	30% fuel savings or Â£120,00 per annum based on a fleet of 100 vehicles\r\nIn addition massive improvements in customer service have been demonstrated:\r\nâ€¢	98% of appointments achieved at first contact\r\nâ€¢	Only 4% missed appointments\r\nâ€¢	95% first time fix\r\nIf you feel this may be of interest I am happy to chat with you over the phone or pop over for another chat. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is of interest. \r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\n','44','0');
