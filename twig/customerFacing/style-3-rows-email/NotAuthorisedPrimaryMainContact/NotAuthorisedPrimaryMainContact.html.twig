    <p>{{ primaryMainContactFirstName }},</p>
    <p>{{ contactFirstName }} {{ contactLastName }} has tried to raise a support request with us but they currently have
        the support level {{ contactSupportLevel }} and as such are unable to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to contact us on their behalf to progress this request and in future, if you would like them to be
        able to raise requests themselves, then please log onto our portal and change their support level.
    </p>
